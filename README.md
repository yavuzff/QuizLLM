# QuizLLM

QuizLLM is a web application that uses OpenAI API to generate quiz questions using the gpt-3.5-turbo model. 
The frontend is built using Streamlit.

To run the project, while ensuring Streamlit is installed, enter the below command in terminal while in the QuizLLM directory:


```streamlit run main.py```


In order to generate a quiz, enter a topic and your OpenAI API key. You can generate an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.
You can then download these questions as a .json file.

Alternatively, you can upload a quiz file, which must be in the same format as the downloaded files.
See the quiz-examples folder to try out some quizzes generated by the LLM model.
