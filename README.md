# QuizLLM

QuizLLM is a web application that uses OpenAI API to generate quiz questions using the gpt-3.5-turbo model. 
The frontend and hosting is done using Streamlit.

Visit https://quiz-llm.streamlit.app to access the web app.

In order to generate a quiz, enter a topic and your OpenAI API key. You can generate an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.
You can then download these questions as a .json file.

Alternatively, you can upload a quiz file, which must be in the same format as the downloaded files.
See the `quiz-examples` folder to try out some quizzes generated by the LLM model.

You can also save the current quiz questions to an AWS S3 bucket. Enter your AWS Access key, Secret key and 
the S3 bucket name in the corresponding text boxes.



If you want to run the project locally, clone the repository and ensure Streamlit is installed. Then run the below command.
You can type `local` in the API key text boxes to access the keys from the environment variables of your local system.

`` streamlit run main.py``
