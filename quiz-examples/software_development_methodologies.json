{"quiz_data": [{"question": "Which software development methodology is known for its iterative and incremental approach?", "options": ["Agile", "Waterfall", "Scrum", "Lean"], "answer": "Agile", "explanation": "Agile is known for its iterative and incremental approach where software is developed in short iterations called sprints, with continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the development process."}, {"question": "Which software development methodology follows a linear, sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance?", "options": ["Agile", "Waterfall", "Scrum", "Lean"], "answer": "Waterfall", "explanation": "The Waterfall methodology is known for its sequential nature, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. This methodology is often used for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, where changes are less likely to occur throughout the development process."}, {"question": "Which software development methodology is based on the principles of eliminating waste and maximizing customer value through continuous improvement?", "options": ["Agile", "Waterfall", "Scrum", "Lean"], "answer": "Lean", "explanation": "Lean methodology focuses on streamlining processes and reducing waste to deliver high-quality products efficiently. It emphasizes customer value, teamwork, and continuous improvement by identifying and eliminating activities that do not add value to the product development."}, {"question": "Which software development methodology utilizes an iterative and incremental approach where development is divided into small, cross-functional teams called 'sprints'?", "options": ["Agile", "Waterfall", "Scrum", "Lean"], "answer": "Scrum", "explanation": "Scrum is a framework within the Agile methodology that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, and iterative development. It divides the project into fixed-length iterations called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks, where teams work on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint."}]}
