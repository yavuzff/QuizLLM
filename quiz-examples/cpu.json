{"quiz_data": [{"question": "What does CPU stand for?", "options": ["Computer Processing Unit", "Central Power Unit", "Control Processing Unit", "Central Processing Unit"], "answer": "Central Processing Unit", "explanation": "CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, which is the primary component of a computer responsible for performing most of the processing inside a computer. It executes instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of data within the computer system."}, {"question": "Which company is known for manufacturing the Ryzen series of CPUs?", "options": ["Apple", "Intel", "AMD", "NVIDIA"], "answer": "AMD", "explanation": "AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, is known for manufacturing the Ryzen series of CPUs. These CPUs offer strong performance and competitive pricing compared to Intel's processors."}, {"question": "What is the current flagship CPU model from Intel?", "options": ["Threadripper 3990X", "Core i9-10900K", "Core i7-9700K", "Ryzen 9 3900X"], "answer": "Core i9-10900K", "explanation": "The current flagship CPU model from Intel is the Core i9-10900K. It is a high-performance processor featuring 10 cores, 20 threads, and a maximum boost clock speed of 5.3 GHz. The Core i9-10900K is designed for gaming and demanding workloads that require intensive processing power."}, {"question": "What is the difference between a CPU and a GPU?", "options": ["CPU is the main processor, while GPU is specialized for graphics processing", "CPU and GPU are the same thing", "GPU is better for multitasking", "CPU is used for graphics processing"], "answer": "CPU is the main processor, while GPU is specialized for graphics processing", "explanation": "A CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are different components in a computer. The CPU is the main processor responsible for general purpose computing tasks, such as running operating systems and applications. On the other hand, the GPU is specialized for handling graphics-related tasks, such as rendering images, videos, and complex animations. GPUs are capable of performing parallel processing much faster than CPUs in certain tasks, making them ideal for graphics-intensive applications like gaming and video editing."}, {"question": "Which architecture is currently used in most modern CPUs?", "options": ["x86", "ARM", "MIPS", "PowerPC"], "answer": "x86", "explanation": "The x86 architecture is currently used in most modern CPUs. It is a widely adopted architecture originally developed by Intel and later licensed to other manufacturers. x86 CPUs are commonly found in personal computers and servers, running operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. ARM is another popular architecture used in mobile devices and embedded systems, while PowerPC and MIPS architectures are less common in consumer-level CPUs."}]}
